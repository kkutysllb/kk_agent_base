    "## 自定义输出解析器\n",
    "\n",
    "在某些情况下，您可能希望实现自定义解析器以将模型输出构造为自定义格式。\n",
    "\n",
    "有两种方法可以实现自定义解析器：\n",
    "- 在 LCEL 中使用 RunnableLambda 或 RunnableGenerator – 我们强烈建议大多数用例使用此方法\n",
    "- 通过从基类之一继承进行解析——这是困难方法\n",
    "\n",
    "这两种方法之间的差异大多是表面的，主要在于触发哪些回调（例如， on_chain_start 与 on_parser_start ）\n",
    "\n",
    "### 可运行的 Lambda 和生成器\n",
    "\n",
    "推荐的解析方法是使用可运行的 lambda 和可运行的生成器！\n",
    "\n",
    "在这里，我们将进行一个简单的解析，反转模型输出的大小写。\n",
    "\n",
    "例如，如果模型输出：“Meow”，解析器将生成“mEOW”。"

      "oNCE UPON A TIME IN THE LUSH, VERDANT FORESTS OF eLDORIA, THERE LIVED AN OLD WISE OWL NAMED oLLIE. tHE FOREST WAS HOME TO MANY CREATURES: RABBITS THAT HOPPED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH, DEER THAT GRAZED ON THE SOFT GREEN GRASS, AND FOXES THAT DARTED BETWEEN TREES. bUT NONE WERE AS RESPECTED OR REVERED AS oLLIE.\n",

      "oNCE UPON A TIME IN A LAND NOT SO FAR AWAY, THERE WAS A SMALL VILLAGE NESTLED BETWEEN ROLLING HILLS AND DENSE FORESTS. tHE VILLAGERS WERE SIMPLE FOLK WHO LIVED OFF THE LAND, GROWING CROPS AND RAISING LIVESTOCK TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES THROUGH THE CHANGING SEASONS.\n",
